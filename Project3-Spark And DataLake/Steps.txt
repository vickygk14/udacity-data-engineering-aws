1. Copy data from three directories to S3 buckes like customer_landing, step_trainer_landing, and accelerometer_landing
2. Create two glue tables customer_landing.sql and accelerometer_landing.sql - share the sql query
3. Query data on above tables and take screen snap customer_landing.png and accelerometer_landing.png


Glue Job
1. customer_landing to customer_trusted -- Filter PII data
2. accelerometer_landing to accelerometer_trusted -- Filter PII data
3. Query your Glue customer_trusted table with Athena and take a screenshot of the data. Name the screenshot customer_trusted(.png,.jpeg, etc.).

Glue Job 
1. Create Glue Job and fetch customer data(trusted) which has accelerometer data(accelerometer_trusted) and agree to share data 
2. 



1. aws s3 cp and copy data to 3 s3 bucket -- customer_landing, step_trainer_landing, and accelerometer_landing
2. Glue Job customer_landing -> filter(PII data) -> customer_trusted
3. Glue Job customer_trusted + accelerometer_landing -> dropfields -> accelerometer_trusted
4. Glue Job customer_trusted + accelerometer_trusted -> drop duplicates -> drop fields -> customer_curated
5. Glue Job step_trainer_landing + customer_curated -> step_trainer_trusted
6. Glue Job step_trainer_trusted + accelerometer_trusted -> same timestamp -> machine_learning_curated
